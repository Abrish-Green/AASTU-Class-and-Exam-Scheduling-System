<h1>     University Class and Exam Scheduling System (UCESS)</h1>
=================================================================== <br />
An automation system that Analyzes a given data and generates a clear and collision free class and exam schedule is the main significance of this project. The automated class and exam scheduling system for university, handles the creation of timetables, which undertakes the scheduling of time for lectures and examinations, including common courses which are given to multiple departments. The system validates users, granting higher privileges to the system administrators. Besides, the system provides database management mechanisms to facilitate persistent data storage as regards courses, examinations, lecture, departments, and so on. The proposed system has the following advantages:
•	Small effort and time.
•	Very flexible rather than too strict.
•	Optimized schedules and avoids human related errors
•	Time Saving for schedule makers.
•	Increased Efficiency.
•	Very interactive and user-friendly interface.
•	It keeps track of instructor’s profiles.

Front-end technologies: For the front-end we decided to use a JavaScript framework that is called Reactjs. which is very easy to learn and helps to create a very interactive content on the screen. Still, we are going to use other fundamental building blocks of web applications and 3rd party frameworks to work together. All the front-end technologies are listed below:
Fundamental technologies:
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
Frameworks and 3rd Party libraries
•	Reactjs
•	jQuery
•	Ajax
•	Bootstrap
Back-end technologies: we selected a good PHP framework which is called Laravel. It is a very popular framework, because of its flexibility at creating routes and REST API’s. The tools used to build and test the back-end system are listed below:
•	 Laravel (back-end technology): a PHP framework that is used to build a back-end of a web application.
•	 Postman (API’s testing tool): API Lifecycle (design, testing and full production) supporter tool
•	 Chrome Browser: used for rendering contents on the screen. 
Database Management system (DBMS): we selected a very popular DB management system which is called MYSQL, easy to use and works best with PHP frameworks.
Editor tools: we selected a proper text editor to write a good code. which has 3rd party plugin integrated with it. The tools are listed below:
•	PhpStorm
•	Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Testing tools: for testing purposes we are going to use the so called “Selenium” tool, which is a web application usability testing tool. It is a testing framework to perform web application testing across various browsers and platforms like Windows, Mac, and Linux.
